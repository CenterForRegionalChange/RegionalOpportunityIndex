            <p><strong>Patterns of Rural Opportunity:  Spatial, Racial, Age,  and Gender Disparities</strong></p>
            
            <p>The Rural Opportunity Index (ROI) is designed to provide an easy and intuitive tool for identifying 
                populations and areas in greatest need of investment to thrive.  The ROI integrate key indicators 
                across a range of important issues—including education, economy, housing, mobility and the 
                environment, and civic life—into a comprehensive measure of opportunity.  We have developed 
                separate ROI indices for both people and place, helping to identify factors associated with 
                the demographic characteristics of people, and factors associated with places in which they 
                live.  In examining these patters across the entire Central Valley region, some interesting 
                overall patterns of disparity in opportunity emerge.</p>
            
            <p><em>Rural-Urban Dynamics</em><sup>1</sup>:</p>
             
            <p>Overall, for both people and place, urban core areas of the valley have the highest levels 
                of opportunity.  This is perhaps not surprising for the Sacramento area, but even major 
                cities of the San Joaquin Valley, such as Fresno and Bakersfield, which has major 
                concentrations of poor populations, still have higher opportunities relative to the 
                smaller towns and cities of the Central Valley.   The lowest levels of opportunity, 
                as measured by our indices, are in those small towns of the Central Valley with populations 
                of less than 10,000 people, but larger than 2,500.  Interestingly, the truly rural parts of 
                the region—those places with no settlement larger than 2,500 and only small amounts of 
                commuting to small towns or larger urban center—have higher levels of opportunity than 
                those small towns of the Valley.  Our interpretation of this is that a higher proportion 
                of people living in those fully rural places have moved there for lifestyle purposes or 
                retirement, and fewer are dependent on the agriculture or natural resource based jobs 
                that typically provide low wages and worse economic circumstances.</p>

            <p><img src="img/equity/Place_by_RUCA.jpg"></p>
            
            <p><em>Racial Disparities vary by sub-region</em></p>

            <p>In trying to understand disparities in opportunity by different racial groups, we decided 
                to look at how patterns differ in sub-regions of our overall analysis area.  The North 
                Valley refers to all counties north of Yuba and Sutter counties.  The Sacramento area 
                refers to the 6 counties covered by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (El Dorado, 
                Sacramento, Placer, Sutter, Yolo, Yuba).  The North San Joaquin Valley includes all counties 
                south of Sacramento but north of Fresno, and South San Joaquin Valley includes Fresno County 
                and those counties further south.</p>
            
            <p>In looking at the Index of People Opportunity, it is clear that across all racial groups, 
                opportunity levels are significantly lower in the San Joaquin Valley (both North and South) 
                than in Sacramento and the North Valley.  It is also clear that in all regions  the non-Hispanic 
                White population has higher levels of opportunity than any other racial group.  The African-American 
                population has the lowest  opportunity level in all sub-regions except the northern San Joaquin 
                Valley, were the Latino population has a slightly lower opportunity score.  African-Americans have 
                a particularly low opportunity score in the South San Joaquin Valley.  For the non-Hispanic White 
                and Asian population, those living in the Sacramento sub-region have the highest opportunity scores.  
                Interestingly, amongst  African-Americans and Latinos,  those living in the North Valley actually 
                have higher opportunity scores than those living in Sacramento.</p>

            <p><img src="img/equity/People_by_Region&Race.jpg"></p>
            
            <p>Looking at the Place Opportunity Index provides some clues to help explain these racial differences 
                in the People Opportunity Index.   Here, the indices can be interpreted as the average opportunity 
                score of the places where people of each racial group live.  The patterns track quite closely to 
                the patterns of the measures of the people themselves, indicating close overall connection between 
                the relative opportunities a neighborhood provides and the relative opportunity people are able 
                to achieve.   It suggests, for example, that at least one reason why African-Americans and Latinos 
                living in the North Valley are doing somewhat better than those living in the Sacramento region is 
                because the particular neighborhoods they are living in in the North Valley have relatively more 
                opportunities than those neighborhoods in Sacramento where they live, which include more areas of 
                concentrated poverty.  Overall, though, the patterns are quite similar, as across all groups, the 
                residential places they live in the San Joaquin Valley (both northern and southern) have 
                substantially less opportunity than those neighborhoods in Sacramento, and in most cases less 
                than in the North Valley as well.</p>

            <p><img src="img/equity/Place_by_Region&Race.jpg"></p>

            <p><em>Disparities by gender and age are less</em></p>
            
            <p>While the opportunities indices show quite large differences in the opportunities available by 
                different racial groups, and analysis of disparities by gender and age show substantially less 
                variation.  There is still a quite clear pattern of less opportunities in the San Joaquin Valley, 
                and particularly in South San Joaquin Valley.  The differences between men and women, however, 
                are generally quite minimal.  The one exception to this, however, is in the very southern San 
                Joaquin Valley, where men have what appear to be substantially lower levels of opportunity, and 
                are living in places with substantially lower opportunities as well.  This is likely due to the 
                disproportionately higher employment of men as farmworkers in the region’s agriculture and food 
                processing industries.</p>

            <p><img src="img/equity/Place_by_Region&Sex.jpg"></p>

            <p>It is also valuable to look at opportunities for youth, and for elderly populations, since they 
                tend to be the most vulnerable populations.  Again, there are similar patterns across sub-regions, 
                with those people and places in the San Joaquin Valley having substantially less opportunities than 
                those in Sacramento in particular.  For the over 65 population, those living in the North Valley 
                have the highest levels of opportunity, despite the place index being lower.  This would make sense 
                if people have retired to this area, having achieved their higher levels of opportunity elsewhere 
                and are thus less hurt by the lower opportunities available in their local areas.  For young people, 
                levels of opportunity in the South San Joaquin Valley are particularly low and worrisome, suggesting 
                a significant need for investing in opportunities for youth in this sub-region of the state.</p>

            <p><sup>1</sup> The ROI covers 19 counties in Central California.  While overall this area is typically considered the rural hinterland of California, compared to the more densely populated areas of Coastal Northern and Southern California, it does include a range of settlements, from large urban centers like Sacramento and Fresno, to smaller cities, to truly rural areas.   To examine the differences in opportunity by levels of urbanization, we use the Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) Codes developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Services, to classify all census tracts into one of four different categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Urban Core:  This includes metropolitan area core tracts, along with surrounding tracts with high degrees of commuting into the core urbanized areas (RUCA Codes 1-3).  This corresponds to all large cities in our area, along with some surrounding area.</li> 
                <li>Large urban cluster:  This includes urban areas of 10,000 to 49,999 population, with surrounding tracts that have high proportions of commuting to those urban areas (RUCA Codes 4-6).  This corresponds to smaller towns such as Avenal or Sanger.</li>
                <li>Small urban cluster:  This includes small towns with population between 2,500 and 9,999, and surrounding areas with populations that commute there (RUCA Codes 7-9).</li>
                <li>Rural areas:  These are truly rural areas with small populations and low or no commute to any of the other areas. (RUCA code 10).</li>
            </ul>
