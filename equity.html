<h4>Patterns of Rural Opportunity: Spatial, Racial, Age, and Gender Disparities</h4>

<p>The Rural Opportunity Index (ROI) is designed to provide an easy and intuitive tool for identifying populations and areas in greatest need of investment to thrive. The ROI integrate key indicators across a range of important issues—including education, economy, housing, mobility and the environment, and civic life—into a comprehensive measure of opportunity. We have developed separate ROI indices for both people and place, helping to identify factors associated with the demographic characteristics of people, and factors associated with places in which they live. In examining these patters across the entire Central Valley region, some interesting overall patterns of disparity in opportunity emerge.</p>

<p><em>Rural-Urban Dynamics1:</em></p>

<p>Overall, for both people and place, urban core areas of the valley have the highest levels of opportunity. This is perhaps not surprising for the Sacramento area, but even major cities of the San Joaquin Valley, such as Fresno and Bakersfield, which has major concentrations of poor populations, still have higher opportunities relative to the smaller towns and cities of the Central Valley. The lowest levels of opportunity, as measured by our indices, are in those small towns of the Central Valley with populations of less than 10,000 people, but larger than 2,500. Interestingly, the truly rural parts of the region—those places with no settlement larger than 2,500 and only small amounts of commuting to small towns or larger urban center—have higher levels of opportunity than those small towns of the Valley. Our interpretation of this is that a higher proportion of people living in those fully rural places have moved there for lifestyle purposes or retirement, and fewer are dependent on the agriculture or natural resource based jobs that typically provide low wages and worse economic circumstances.</p>

<p>It is also valuable to look at opportunities for youth, and for elderly populations, since they tend to be the most vulnerable populations. Again, there are similar patterns across sub-regions, with those people and places in the San Joaquin Valley having substantially less opportunities than those in Sacramento in particular. For the over 65 population, those living in the North Valley have the highest levels of opportunity, despite the place index being lower. This would make sense if people have retired to this area, having achieved their higher levels of opportunity elsewhere and are thus less hurt by the lower opportunities available in their local areas. For young people, levels of opportunity in the South San Joaquin Valley are particularly low and worrisome, suggesting a significant need for investing in opportunities for youth in this sub-region of the state.</p>
